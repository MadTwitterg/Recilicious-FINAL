## Phase 1: Core Features & Setup
### Week 1-2: Initial Setup
- [ ] Set up the project repository and initialize a version control system (Git).
- [ ] Integrate the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data.
- [ ] Implement basic app structure (Homepage, Search, Recipe Details, Cookbook).

### Week 3: Basic UI/UX Design
- [ ] Design a simple, user-friendly homepage displaying "Recipes for Today."
- [ ] Create a responsive search bar for ingredient-based searches.

- [ ] Implement filtering options by food origin (e.g., Italian, Asian, etc.).
- [ ] Add mineral-based filtering (e.g., high in iron, calcium).
- [ ] Enable sorting by factors like cook time, calorie count, and number of ingredients.

### Week 6: Dark/Light Mode & Styling
- [ ] Develop a dark mode/light mode toggle switch.

- [ ] Allow users to sync their saved recipes across devices.

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
### Week 10: Testing
- [ ] Conduct unit tests for core functionalities (search, filtering, saving recipes).
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback.
- [ ] Debug and optimize API calls for performance.

### Week 11: Performance & Bug Fixes
- [ ] Optimize app performance for faster load times and smooth transitions.
- [ ] Fix UI bugs and improve overall user experience.

## Phase 5: Launch & Post-Launch
### Week 12: Launch & Marketing
- [ ] Prepare the app for deployment on app stores (iOS & Android).
- [ ] Create marketing materials (screenshots, descriptions).
